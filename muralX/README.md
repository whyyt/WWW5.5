# muralX — Explore, Express, Experience

## About **mural**X
Once, commissioning art was a privilege of the few. Today, it can be for anyone.

Discover your next Rembrandt, start your own Guggenheim collection, or release your inner Frida. MuralX brings artists and art lovers together to spark ideas, create made-to-order artworks, and make a lasting impact in the community. 

## The muralX Experience
muralX is a decentralized platform that allows users to commission, create, and share art. Participants can take on the role of a patron, an artist, or both. Patrons can commission artworks crafted to their specific vision, while artists can showcase their creations and compete for commissions. The platform functions like a dynamic museum, where commissions, collections, and creations are displayed for the community to explore. Powered by blockchain, muralX ensures direct communication between patrons and artists, promising a fair, transparent, and secure process with no platform fees.
